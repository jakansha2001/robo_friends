# ðŸ¤– **Robo Friends**
This application is developed with Flutter. 

It is a great example to learn the following things:
- Cool and beautiful UI (Background Gradient, GridView, Custom Positioning inside Stack, etc.)
- Rest API with HTTP
- Using Custom Fonts
- Feature Driven Architecture
- Single Responsibility Principle

This application fetches users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and it also fetches robot images from https://robohash.org/${id}?200x200.

It implements lazy loading using GridView.builder and caching using CachedNetworkImage. 

User can search for a particular robot and can also save their favourite robots in SharedPreference.
